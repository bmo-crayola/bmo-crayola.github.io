            <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
            <p> Text is represented using numerical codes. Early systems used <strong>ASCII</strong>, where each character is stored as a 7-bit binary number, allowing for 128 unique characters. This includes standard English letters, digits, and some special characters.
                However, ASCII is limited in scope and cannot represent characters from other languages or special symbols. To address this limitation, <strong>Unicode</strong> was developed.
                Unicode uses a variable-length encoding system, such as UTF-8 <strong>(We add &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; in html for the same reasosn)</strong>, which can use one to four bytes per character. This allows for over a million unique characters, accommodating
                virtually all written languages and a wide range of symbols. Unicode has become the standard for text representation in modern computing due to its versatility and comprehensiveness.
