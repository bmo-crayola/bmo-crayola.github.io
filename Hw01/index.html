            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> Data is a very broad term that refers to the symbols or characters used to represent any sort of information, whether it be people, images
                or anything else. Conceptually, it is similar to variables in math or computer science, some amount of data like<strong> x, y, or z, </strong>can represent
                a value or a set of values. However, these values are meaningless when taken outside of the scope within which they were being discussed,
                similarly to how if you took a variable x out of an equation and stuck it in a regular sentence, it would stop representing a mathimatical 
                meaning, but now a linguistic one. This extends to virtually any way of representing information, whether it be numbers, text, images, or 
                anything else. We can represent data in many different ways, and each way has its own advantages and disadvantages.
