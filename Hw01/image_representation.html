            <h2>Pixels and Grids</h2>
            <p> Images are represented using a grid of pixels, where each pixel is a tiny square that contains color information. The color of each pixel 
                is typically represented using the RGB color model, which uses three values to represent the intensity of red, green, and blue light. This
                is because pixels in most screens are made up off of 3 cells, a red one, blue one, and a green one. Depending on the intensity of light
                coming from each of these cells, our eyes are to a degree tricked to see the color that we end up seeing. Each value can range from 
                <strong>0 to 255</strong>, allowing for over <strong>16 million</strong> possible colors. The resolution of an image is determined by the number of 
                pixels in the grid. Higher resolution images have more pixels and can display more detail, but they also require more storage space.
                Images can be stored in various file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Each format has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms 
                of compression, quality, and support for features like transparency and animation.
