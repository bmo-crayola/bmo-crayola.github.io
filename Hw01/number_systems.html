            <h2>Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal</h2>
            <p> There are different ways to represent numbers, and each way has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common way to represent numbers is the decimal system,
                which is a<strong> base 10 </strong>system. This means that there are 10 different digits <strong>(0-9)</strong> that can be used to represent any number. The decimal system is the most familiar
                to us because it is the one we use in our everyday lives. However, there are other ways to represent numbers that are more efficient for computers to use.
                One of these is the binary system, which is a<strong> base 2 </strong>sysstem. This means that there are only <strong>0s and 1s</strong> that can be used to represent any number.
                The binary system is more efficient for computers because it is easier for them to process 2 different states (on and off) than it is for them to process 10 different states.
                Another way to represent numbers is the hexadecimal system, which is a<strong> base 16 </strong>system. This means that there are 16 different digits <strong>(0-9 and A-F)</strong> that can be used to represent any number.
                The hexadecimal system is often used in computer science because it is more compact than the binary system, and it is easier for humans to read than binary.
